# Python-Group-Assignment-
Student Management System (Python terminal based)

A role-based academic management system built with Python to support daily operations within an educational institution.
The application enables administrators, teachers, students, and staff to manage courses, enrolments, schedules, attendance, grades, and institutional announcements in a centralized environment.
